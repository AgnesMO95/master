## Repository Structure

### Images

### Clone Repository

In terminal of preference, go to directory you want the repository to be added. To clone the repository run the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/catthiba/project-thesis.git
```

Direct into the folder project-thesis, and then to the folder src.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

In order to run the application both the back-end server and the front-end development server must run. How to start the back-end server is explained in the back-end readme.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
